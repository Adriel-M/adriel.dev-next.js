# [SqlDelight Dialect for CockroachDB](https://github.com/Faire/sqldelight-cockroachdb-dialect)

A dialect enabling the usage of CockroachDB with SqlDelight. Written in Kotlin + Gradle and BNF to define the grammar. Interacted and contributed with two other downstream projects ([SqlDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) and [sql-psi](https://github.com/AlecKazakova/sql-psi)) to understand how to create this dialect to inherit from Postgres and add on CockroachDB specific grammar.

# [Cockroach Mutliregion demo](https://github.com/Adriel-M/cockroach-multiregion-demo)

An electron app to showcase the various multiregion modes for CockroachDB.
